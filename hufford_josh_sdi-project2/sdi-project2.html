<p>My theme this week is a restaurant hostess trying to seat a large party.</p>
<p>While I intended to maintain the flight checkin theme from last week, or at least maintain the general theme of transportation, the logic just flowed better for this assignment themed as a restaurant hostess.</p>
<p>I find it odd thinking about all the restaurants I've been to recently, and it's always been a hostess; no hosts at a single restaurant..</p>
<p>If I need to stick to the transportation theme, I could simply claim this is the dining car of a train, though they usually try to feed everyone like an assembly line.</p>
